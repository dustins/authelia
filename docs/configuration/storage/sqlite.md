# SQLite

If you don't have a SQL server, you can use [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite).
However please note that this setup will prevent you from running multiple
instances of Authelia since the database will be a local file.

## Configuration

Just give the path to the sqlite database. It will be created if the file does not exist.

```yaml
storage:
  local:
    path: /config/db.sqlite3
```
