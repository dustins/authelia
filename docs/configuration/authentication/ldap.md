# LDAP

**Authelia** supports using a LDAP server as the users database.

## Configuration

Configuration of the LDAP backend is done as follows

```yaml
authentication_backend:
  disable_reset_password: false
  ldap:
    # The url to the ldap server. Scheme can be ldap:// or ldaps://
    url: ldap://127.0.0.1

    # Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow self-signed certificate).
    skip_verify: false

    # The base dn for every entries
    base_dn: dc=example,dc=com

    # The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate
    # the username in the session information. It was introduced due to #561 to handle case
    # insensitive search queries.
    # For you information, Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP
    # usually uses 'uid'
    username_attribute: uid
    
    # An additional dn to define the scope to all users
    additional_users_dn: ou=users
    
    # The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
    # Various placeholders are available to represent the user input and back reference other options of the configuration:
    # - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form. 
    # - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
    # - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
    # - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later versions, so please don't use it.
    #
    # Recommended settings are as follows:
    # - Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))
    # - OpenLDAP: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))' or '(&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))
    #
    # To allow sign in both with username and email, one can use a filter like
    # (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
    users_filter: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))
    
    # An additional dn to define the scope of groups
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups
    
    # The groups filter used in search queries to find the groups of the user.
    # - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form.
    # - {username} is a placeholder replace by the username stored in LDAP (based on `username_attribute`).
    # - {dn} is a matcher replaced by the user distinguished name, aka, user DN.
    # - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
    # - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
    # - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later versions, so please don't use it.
    # - DON'T USE - {1} is an alias for {username} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later version, so please don't use it.
    groups_filter: (&(member={dn})(objectclass=groupOfNames))
    
    # The attribute holding the name of the group
    group_name_attribute: cn
    
    # The attribute holding the mail address of the user
    mail_attribute: mail
    
    # The username and password of the admin user.
    user: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
    
    # This secret can also be set using the env variables AUTHELIA_AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND_LDAP_PASSWORD
    password: password
```

The user must have an email address in order for Authelia to perform
identity verification when password reset request is initiated or
when a second factor device is registered.
