# First Factor

2-Factor authentication is a method in which a user is granted access by presenting
two pieces of evidence that she is who she claims to be.

**Authelia** requires usual username and password as a first factor.

*IMPORTANT: This is currently the only method available as first factor. Using other methods will likely be possible when [WebAuthN](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/241) is implemented*

Authelia supports several kind of users databases:

* An LDAP server like OpenLDAP or OpenAM.
* An Active Directory.
* A YAML file
